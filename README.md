# CSP-BMI
A motor imagery brain-machine interface based on CSP and machine learning.

CSP-BMI reads electroencephalogram data from simpleEEGStreamer through TCP/IP, and sends the output to Unity through UDP for visual feedback.

Use GUI.m for startup.

pthreadVC2.dll is needed for simpleEEGStreamer.
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox is needed for LDA.
